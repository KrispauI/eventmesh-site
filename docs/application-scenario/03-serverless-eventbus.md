# Serverless Event Bus for Cloud Services

*   Application scenario name

&emsp;&emsp;**Serverless Event Bus for Cloud Services**
 

*   Application scenario description

&emsp;&emsp;Cloud service providers can build a Serverless Event Bus using `EventMesh` to facilitate and manage events across various sources, including traditional applications, cloud-native services, and SaaS partner applications. In this scenario, the Serverless Event Bus powered by EventMesh helps developers create loosely coupled and distributed event-driven serverless microservice applications without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.

&emsp;&emsp;This Serverless Event Bus supports asynchronous event communication across different cloud environments. It simplifies protocol management by routing events between services, making it  suitable for multi-cloud, hybrid cloud architectures, and third-party SaaS systems. Additionally, the bus can be deployed in distributed environments, ensuring reliable event delivery even under heavy load, thanks to `EventMesh`â€™s cross-region failover and load-balancing capabilities.

  
*   Application scenario implementation proposal

&emsp;&emsp;Cloud service provider Huawei Cloud offers a Serverless Event Bus service called `EventGrid`, which is based on `EventMesh`. `EventGrid` uses `EventMesh` as its runtime engine and supports the integration of Huawei Cloud services, custom applications, and SaaS applications in a standardized, centralized manner. By utilizing the standardized CloudEvents protocol, it flexibly routes events between applications, building a loosely coupled, distributed event-driven architecture. This not only creates more application scenarios for Huawei Cloud but also further enriches the developer ecosystem.

&emsp;&emsp;As a crucial part of the event-driven architecture in a Serverless environment, it provides elastic, asynchronous, and decentralized event governance services. Key functions include event aggregation, schema validation, filtering, routing, transformation, and pushing. Additionally, it offers enhanced features like fault-tolerant retries, dead-letter storage, event query tracking, and event workflows.

&emsp;&emsp;The diagram above represents the overall architecture of Huawei Cloud `EventGrid`. `EventGrid` connects to various cloud services as event sources, including Distributed Message Service, Object Storage Service (OBS), and Distributed Cache Service. The various events generated by these event sources are pushed to the event channels of the `EventGrid` Event Bus (Bus Runtime). The Event Bus configures event channels for EventGrid users on a per-tenant basis, allowing multiple event channels under a single tenant to carry events from different sources.

&emsp;&emsp;`EventGrid`, as the standard event hub for Huawei Cloud, enables interconnection between various cloud services. Cloud services, acting as event sources or event targets, are deployed on Huawei Cloud's Serverless application platform. Applications push real-time business events to the event grid, where the event grid filters, routes, and transforms the events to trigger cloud services subscribed to those events. `EventGrid` currently supports over 100+ built-in Huawei Cloud event sources and allows for custom and partner event extensions. Additionally, it is supported by a vast array of official data sources, covering databases, messaging, serverless computing, big data, DevOps platforms, IoT, and more, with custom event integration capabilities.
